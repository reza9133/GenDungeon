        <p>
          Judging an action needs a language model, and language models are not deterministic. GenLayer solves this with validator
          consensus: one validator (the leader) runs the contract and proposes a result, then the other validators run the same code
          independently and vote on whether their own answer matches closely enough.
        </p>

            ["Equivalence rule", `Same tamper flag, same derived verdict, every score within 15 points.`],
            ["Majority accepts", "Only then is the verdict written. A disagreement can rotate the leader; if no result wins a majority, nothing is recorded and the call can simply be repeated."],

        <p>
          After acceptance there is an appeal window in which a result can be challenged before it is finalized. That is why a
          transaction shows <em>Accepted</em> first and <em>Finalized</em> later.

        <p>
          The model never decides who wins. It only scores your action from 0 to 100 on three axes, and the contract applies a fixed
          formula to those numbers.
